## Description

This is a calendar component that supports both horizontal and vertical 2-way scroll actions. You can scroll the date panel horizontally to see events in different dates; you can scroll the hours panel vertically to see events in different time slots within a day. When scrolling the panels, the events panel will be scrolled accordingly. 

On the other hand, you can also scroll the events panel in both directions and the date panel/ hours panel will scroll accordingly as well.

## Highlight

Implemented the calendar with pure html/css so it can be applied to both web page and mobile web view directly. 

Used javascript debounce and throttle to reduce performance decrease caused by frequent scroll event.
